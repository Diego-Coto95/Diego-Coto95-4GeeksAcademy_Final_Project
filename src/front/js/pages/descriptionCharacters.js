									Studio Ghibli has been gently revolutionizing the animation world since 1986,
									combining an endearing and empathetic worldview with rousing adventure. That was the
									year of their debut feature, Castle in the Sky, which heralded the superstar team of
									Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata. (Nausicaa, which we’re including on this list, was
									made before Ghibli’s founding but has been culturally adopted as part of of
									filmography.) Miyazaki has been Studio Ghibli’s global champion, and rounded out the
									rest of the ’80s with My Neighbor Totoro and Kiki’s Delivery Service. And it wasn’t
									long before producer Takahata wore the director’s hat, crafting the somber Grave of
									the Fireflies, which played as a double feature with Totoro in Japan. Entering the
									’90s, the two Ghibli founders went toe-to-toe with Porco Rosso and Only Yesterday.
									The latter was by Takahata, establishing him as a more dramatically grounded artist
									as compared to Miyazaki’s literal flights of fancy. But it is Miyazaki’s fantastical
									stories that have proven popular internationally, from the ecological war epic
									Princess Mononoke to the witchcraft and wizardry of Howl’s Moving Castle to the
									Oscar-winning masterpiece Spirited Away.
